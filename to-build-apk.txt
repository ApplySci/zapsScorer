Building a release APK
Using the command line:
    > cd <app dir> (the one containing pubspec.yaml)
    > flutter build apk (flutter build defaults to --release).
The release APK for your app is created at <app dir>/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk.

Installing a release APK on a device
Connect your Android device to your computer with a USB cable.
Using the command line:
    > cd <app dir> (as above)
    > flutter install

To avoid the Play Store warning with current Flutter stable release, app authors are required to build and upload separate APKs for 32-bit and 64-bit:

    flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm
    flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm64
